It's been almost one month since I strated my journey as a Researcher at the University of Leeds. I received the Newton International Fellowship from the Royal Society to work with the project # Understanding spatio-temporal variability of soil organic carbon under climate change scenarios. As this is a relative new topic to me, I strated to read a lot about soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring. I already have experience mapping soil properties by digital soil mapping approaches (DSM) using remote sensing variables, soil spectroscopy and machine learning, but not so much about SOC monitoring spatially and over time.  
Therefore, I took some time to lean more about this 'hot' topic.

    "summary": "Hey there! I am Nélida and recently I received my PhD in Soil Science and Plant Nutrition from the University of São Paulo, in Brazil. During my graduate years, I worked with digital soil mapping, remote sensing and soil spectroscopy. I also had the opportunity to be a Visiting Scientist at Iowa State University, in the United States, where I worked with digital mapping of drainage classes. In January 2022, I received the Newton International Fellowship from The Royal Society and I'll join the University of Leeds to work as a Researcher. There, I'll be conducting research with the main aim to understand soil carbon spatio-temporal dynamics in agricultural systems to support decision making under climate change.",

Soil mineralogy is one of the soil properties that is poorly analyzed in soils. The main reasons for this are the need of time-consuming field sampling and expensive chemical reactants, which prevent their inclusion in traditional laboratory analysis. Fortunately, soil spectroscopy can help us with that.  
Generally speaking, which help us to know how much of a specific mineral we have in the soil is the absorption feature observed in spectral curves at specific wavelenghts.

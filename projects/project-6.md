summary: Do you know that it is possible to estimate the abundance of specific soil minerals in the soil using soil spectroscopy?

Soil mineralogy is one of the soil properties that is poorly analyzed in soils. The main reasons for this are the need of time-consuming field sampling and expensive chemical reactants, which prevent their inclusion in traditional laboratory analysis. Fortunately, soil spectroscopy can help us with that.
